# Tutorials

## Installation

Installation of the Element requires an integrated development environment and database.
Instructions to setup each of the components can be found on the
[User Instructions](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/user-guide) page. 

There, you'll find instructions referencing other DataJoint Element 'Workflows' (e.g.,
[workflow for Element DeepLabCut](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-deeplabcut)),
which serves as a model for developing custom pipelines. While the workflow for Facemap is
still under development, these can serve as a model for integrating Elements into a pipeline.
