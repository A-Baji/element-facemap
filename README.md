# DataJoint Element - Facemap
This repository features DataJoint pipeline design for videographic processing of head-fixed rodent behavior with `Facemap`.

The element presented here is not a complete workflow by itself,
 but rather a modular design of tables and dependencies specific to the Facemap workflow. 

This modular element can be flexibly attached downstream to 
any particular design of experiment session, thus assembling 
a fully functional calcium imaging workflow.

See [Background](Background.md) for the background information and development timeline.
