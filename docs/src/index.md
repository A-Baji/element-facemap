# Element Facemap

DataJoint element for tracking facial movements of a mouse with
[Facemap](https://github.com/MouseLand/facemap) analysis package. DataJoint Elements
collectively standardize and automate data collection and analysis for neuroscience
experiments. Each Element is a modular pipeline for data storage and processing with
corresponding database tables that can be combined with other Elements to assemble a
fully functional pipeline.

Facemap applies singular value decomposition (SVD) to face movie to extract the
principal components (PCs) that explain distinct movements apparent on mouseâ€™s
face. The Element is composed of a single schema for storing data and running analysis:
`facial_behavior_estimation`.
