# Element Facemap

DataJoint element for pose tracking of mouse face from different camera views and
singular value decomposition processing of videos with Mouseland's
[Facemap](https://github.com/MouseLand/facemap) analysis package. DataJoint Elements
collectively standardize and automate data collection and analysis for neuroscience
experiments. Each Element is a modular pipeline for data storage and processing with
corresponding database tables that can be combined with other Elements to assemble a
fully functional pipeline.

The element itself is comprised of a single schema, `facial_behavior_estimation`. For
more information on the Functional Calcium Imaging and the development of the Element,
see the [concepts page](./concepts.md).
